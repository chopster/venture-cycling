			p As a National Standards Cycling Instructor I primarily work in schools around Berkshire delivering Bikeability cycle training to Year 5 and 6 children. However, I am fully committed to cycling for all, and I work with children and adults of all ages and abilities, providing training from learning to balance and ride to planning commutes across busy town centres. I am also a qualified Ride Leader with British Cycling and I lead Breeze cycle rides encouraging ladies to get out on their bikes, friendly social rides with coffee stops. 

			p I am fully insured, a member of CTC and British cycling. I am CRB checked, trained in supporting SEN and hold a current First Aid certificate. I am also accredited with Cycle Experience as a mechanic to be able to deliver Dr Bike sessions.
