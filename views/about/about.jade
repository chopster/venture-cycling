				p Kelly is an award winning cycle instructor and has helped hundreds of local children to take to two wheels with confidence, and control. Kelly is committed to cycling for all, and works with children and adults of all ages and abilities, helping them to enjoy learning to cycle, or improve their cycling skills through an easy and fun step by step method.

				p Lessons are offered on a 1:1 basis, or for siblings together, allowing Kelly to structure lessons to meet individual needs and most trainee cyclists learn to ride in just one or two lessons. 

				p Kelly is also a qualified Ride Leader with British Cycling and leads Breeze cycle rides encouraging ladies to get out on their bikes, friendly social rides with coffee stops.

				p Kelly is fully insured, a member of CTC and British Cycling. She has successfully registered Venture Cycling with the Department of Transport as a Bikeability provider. She is CRB checked, trained and very experienced in supporting those with special educational needs and disabilities and holds a current First Aid certificate.

				p Each lesson will start with a bike check, and Kelly is an experienced cycle mechanic, and will ensure that your child's bike is safe to ride and set up correctly for them.
