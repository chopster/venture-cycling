			p My daughter could not cycle after numerous frustrating days out trying to find playgrounds and car parks on rainy sundays, BUT after 1 lesson with Kelly she is confident and completed a circuit around the race course unaided with a smile as big as the stand. If your child is nervous or has problems with co-ordination I definitely would recommend Kelly most highly!

			p After 2 hours she is cycling well without any help and can't wait to be out on her bike.

			p My daughter has had a lesson with Kelly and has come on leaps and bounds. Kelly is amazing.

			p Kelly is great would highly recommend!!

			p Hi all i would just like to say thank you to those of you that recommended Kelly Koya to me. In two lessons she has helped my 6 year daughter to ride her bike. So pleased! Would highly recommend. Thank you Kelly Koya

			p It's a brilliant service. Highly recommend!
