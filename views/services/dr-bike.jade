				p As an accredited cycle mechanic Kelly can carry out minor repairs, adjustments and servicing, both for individuals and organisations that may wish to hold a Bike clinic for employees.

				p All bikes are checked prior to lessons, but if your bike has been unused for a while, or has an mechanical issue, why not book it in for a full check up before your lesson or ride?

				p A basic service costs just Â£20. Your bike will be thoroughly checked over, and brakes and gears adjusted. Advice will be given if any parts need replacing or further work is necessary.
