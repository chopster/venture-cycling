						h4 Learn to Ride - Children
						p Teaching children to cycle is a challenge for many parents. I can take the stress out of the process by providing fun, relaxed lessons to promote excellent early riding skills. Lessons are structured for development through fun, game based methods that children really enjoy.

						p While some children learn in as little as a single 45 minute lesson, every child is different. I work with each child at a pace that suits them, and takes a flexible approach in adapting lessons to ensure any additional needs or requirements are met. This ensures your child has an enjoyable and productive lesson. Please <a href="/contact" class="link">contact me</a> if you would like to discuss any special requirements.
