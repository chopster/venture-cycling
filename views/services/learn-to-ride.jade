			p Teaching children to cycle is a challenge for many parents. Kelly can take the stress out of the process by providing fun, relaxed lessons to promote excellent early riding skills. Lessons are structured for development through fun, game based methods that children really enjoy.

			p For younger children, Kelly offers a balance program designed to improve their co-ordination, and balance bike riding skills ready for cycling independently. Kelly is a fully qualified Balanceability instructor and can teach children from 2.5 years upwards the skills needed to start riding a balance bike before moving to pedal bikes.

			p While some children learn in as little as a single one hour lesson, every child is different. Kelly works with each child at a pace that suits them, and takes a flexible approach in adapting lessons to ensure any additional needs or requirements are met. This ensures your child has an enjoyable and productive lesson. Please <a href="/contact" class="link">contact me</a> if you would like to discuss any special requirements.
